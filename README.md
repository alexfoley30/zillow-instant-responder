# Zillow Instant Responder

Sub-30-second auto-reply to new Zillow rental inquiries. This is the "instant layer."
The existing 5-minute sweep stays as the "smart layer" for booking/calendar.

## How it works

```
New Zillow email lands in alex@azfoleyhomes.com
   -> Composio Gmail trigger fires a webhook POST to this service
   -> service parses inquirer name + property address from the subject
   -> sends Template 1 availability-ask in-thread (via Composio)
   -> labels the thread zillow/awaiting-renter
Renter has a reply in a few seconds, 24/7, independent of Alex's Mac.
```

No AI in the hot path = no token cost, no Anthropic key, dirt cheap to run.
`responder.py` is pure Python standard library — no pip install, no build step.

## What's already done (by Claude)

- `responder.py` — the full webhook receiver + reply logic (idempotent, secret-verified)
- `render.yaml` — one-file deploy config for Render
- This runbook

## What only YOU can do (firm reasons)

These three steps require creating accounts / entering credentials / approving access,
which Claude is not permitted to do on your behalf. Each is a few minutes.

### Step 1 — Rotate your Composio key (security, do this first)

The old key (`ck_7SYX8U2k...`) was pasted into a chat transcript, so treat it as exposed.
1. Go to app.composio.dev -> Settings -> API Keys.
2. Revoke the old key, generate a new one. Copy it (you'll paste it in Step 3).

### Step 2 — Create the Composio Gmail trigger

1. In the Composio dashboard, open the Gmail app -> Triggers.
2. Enable the "New Gmail Message" trigger (a.k.a. GMAIL_NEW_GMAIL_MESSAGE) for the
   connected account `gmail_boast-punnet` (alex@azfoleyhomes.com).
3. Filter it to inbound Zillow only if the UI allows a sender/query filter:
   `from:convo.zillow.com`. (If it can't pre-filter, that's fine — the service ignores
   non-inquiry subjects, so worst case it gets a few extra harmless POSTs.)
4. Set the trigger's webhook/callback URL to your deployed service URL from Step 3,
   path `/`, and add the shared secret header `X-Webhook-Secret: <WEBHOOK_SECRET>`
   if the trigger UI supports custom headers. (If not, we rely on the secret in the URL.)

### Step 3 — Deploy the service (Render, ~$7/mo always-on)

1. Create a free account at render.com.
2. New -> Web Service -> connect this folder's git repo (or "Deploy from a public Git repo"
   pointing at wherever you push this folder).
3. Render auto-detects `render.yaml`. Pick the **Starter** plan (NOT Free — Free sleeps
   and kills instant response).
4. In the service's Environment tab, set:
   - `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` = your new key from Step 1
   - `COMPOSIO_CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID` = `gmail_boast-punnet`
   - `AWAITING_RENTER_LABEL_ID` = `Label_1717014254813700027`  (zillow/awaiting-renter)
   - `HANDLED_LABEL_ID` = `Label_6932202305849666189`  (zillow/handled)
   - `WEBHOOK_SECRET` = make up a long random string; use the same value in Step 2's header
5. Deploy. Copy the live URL (e.g. `https://zillow-instant-responder.onrender.com`) and
   paste it into the Composio trigger from Step 2.

### Step 4 — Test

Hit the URL in a browser — you should see `zillow-instant-responder ok` (health check).
Then send a test Zillow-style inquiry (or wait for a real one) and confirm a reply goes
out in seconds and the thread gets the `zillow/awaiting-renter` label.

## Notes / honesty

- The exact Composio v3 execute endpoint path and trigger payload shape can drift with
  their API version. `responder.py` is defensive about payload shape, but if the first
  real trigger logs a parse miss, send Claude the logged payload and it'll adjust
  `extract_event()` in one edit.
- Once this is live and confirmed, the 5-minute sweep can be slowed to ~10-15 min (it's
  now just a backstop for booking replies), cutting cost further. Tell Claude when ready.
- If you ever want to avoid the monthly host cost, the alternative is running this on an
  always-on office machine behind a Cloudflare Tunnel — more setup, Mac/office-dependent,
  but $0/mo. Ask Claude if you want that path instead.
